      <a name="h4-introductory-questions"> </a><h4>Introductory Questions</h4>

      
      <ul><ul>
        <li>Aristotle once wrote, “Man is by nature a social animal.” What do you think he meant?
            <p> “Man is by nature a social animal; an individual who is unsocial naturally and not accidentally is either beneath our notice or more than human. Society is something that precedes the individual. Anyone who either cannot lead the common life or is so self-sufficient as not to need to, and therefore does not partake of society, is either a beast or a god. ”
            </p>
        </li><li>Why do you think we form relationships with other people?
            <p><a href="https://behumanproject.net/why-are-we-tribal/">One major reason is survival.</a> Humans are tribal creatures like monkyes and goats.  They rely on each other for protection</p>
        </li><li>What makes some relationships more lasting or more meaningful than others?
            <p>There are a lot of answers to this question.<a href="ahttps://www.huffingtonpost.com/yourtango/12-commandments-of-happy-relationships_b_8222190.html"> Here are 12.</a> Things like honesty, trust and understanding.</p>
        </li><li>Are some people more social than others? If so, why do you think this is?
            <p>"Yes. The main differences between extraverts and introverts are that extraverts are less susceptible to fear than introverts. They simply seem to have a lesser innate ability to learn to anticipate negative events such as  frustrating, painful or frightening events." See the full article<a href="http://reflectd.co/2013/03/21/why-are-some-people-more-social-than-others-the-difference-between-introverts-and-extraverts/"> here</a></p>
        </li><li>Friendship comes with benefits; does it also come with costs?
            <p>All frienships have a money <a href="https://www.paymentsense.co.uk/blog/the-true-cost-of-friendship-infographic-survey/">cost</a>.  However, I suppose there are good and bad friendships. Good ones support us and take away little in return. Bad ones suck our energy. <a href="http://thrivebradford.org.uk/friends-and-relationships/friends-good-and-bad.html">Here</a> is a list of qualities found in these costly friends.</p>
        </li><li>For many people, the most important human relationships are those they form with their families. Are family relationships similar all over the world, or do they vary meaningfully by culture? And, is it always better to be close to your family?
            <p>Yes they are very different.  Read about <a href="http://worldfamilymap.ifstudies.org/2015/articles/world-family-indicators/family-culture">worldwide trends</a> in opinions toward issues such as single motherhood, working mothers and familty trust.</p>
        </li><li>Is there anyone with whom you thought you’d never become friends, but to whom you are now close? Conversely, is there anyone with whom you thought you’d be friends forever, but from whom you have since grown apart?
            <p>This is a bit of a peronsal questions.  However, if <a href="http://www.cracked.com/article_22710_5-sworn-enemies-who-formed-inspiring-friendships.html">these five </a>can forgive each other so can you.</p>
        </li><li>Are your friends mostly IRL, or do many of them live on the internet? How are relationships different across different mediums of communication and interaction?

          <li>Some communities create boundaries between themselves and the rest of the world; does living within such boundaries affect how relationships form?

      <a name="h4-questions-for-further-discussion"> </a><h4>Questions for Further Discussion</h4>
      
      <ul><ul>
      <li>Consider the <a href="https://romneymanassa.wordpress.com/2014/05/19/the-first-handshake/">Monument of Kalhu</a>, believed to be the oldest-surviving record of a handshake, then discuss with your team: why are handshakes as universal a gesture as they are? (And are they as universal as people think?) What are alternatives to handshakes within and across different cultures?
      </li><li>This <a href="http://time.com/3265733/nuclear-family-typical-society-parents-children-households-philip-cohen/">linked TIME article</a> discusses the changing American family, but industrialization (and technologization) is changing families around the world. What does your family look like? Have families changed since your parents were children? Your grandparents?
      
      </li><li>Compare these two isolated societies—<a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/sentinelese-tribe-north-sentinel-island-bay-of-bengal-india-andeman-video-footage-uncontacted-a7663996.html">one that still resists contact</a>, and <a href="https://pib.socioambiental.org/en/povo/bororo/241">one that tried to</a>, but failed. Would it be in the best interests of such societies to reach out, and should we try to contact them? How would it affect them if they integrated into a globalized environment?
      </li><li>Research <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/photo-booth/invisible-bridges-life-along-the-chinese-russian-border">border towns</a> around the world - such as Heihe and Blagoveshchensk, El Paso and Juarez, and Shenzhen and Hong Kong - and discuss with your team: do these communities benefit from their entanglements? How notably are their cultures impacted? Should governments do more to open cities to their cross-border counterparts?
      </li><li>What are some of the psychological reasons that we interact with other people the way we do? Consider the <a href="https://masscommtheory.com/theory-overviews/spiral-of-silence/">spiral of silence theory</a>. Have you ever refrained from voicing your opinion for fear of negative consequences? In hindsight, would it have been better if you had spoken up?
      </li><li>Look into the Five Bonds of Confucianism, then discuss with your team: how well do they describe relationships in today's world, and should we try to follow them in our own lives? If you had to list the bonds you believe apply most to modern society, what would they be, and how much would they vary from culture to culture or place to place?
      </li><li>Consider <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/07/real-trouble-making-friends-middle-age/325837/">this article</a>, then discuss with your team: in your experience, does the process of making friends actually differ as you age? Should we create more situations in which it is easier for older people to make friends?
      </li><li><a href="http://time.com/5028171/health-benefits-owning-dog/">Studies suggest</a> that people with pets (in this case, dogs) live longer. Discuss with your team: is it possible for animals to substitute for humans in terms of companionship and friendship? Do humans ultimately need to lead lives entangled with those of others in order to be their healthiest, happiest selves?
      </li><li>In some societies, human relationships are organized by formal or informal <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-35650616">caste systems</a>; the linked article suggests that such a caste system continues to impact society in the world's largest democracy, India. Discuss with your team: do you recognize any "caste systems" in your own lives, offline or online? And, are they necessarily a bad thing?
      </li><li>Why is the exchange of rings linked to marriage in so much of the world – and are there any widespread alternatives?
      </li><li>Furby, Paro, even (someday) BB8: is it possible (and/or desirable) for people to have human-like relationships with <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-24949081">artificial friends</a>?
      </li><li>In China, millions of people <a href="https://a16z.com/2015/08/06/wechat-china-mobile-first/">talk, shop, and work through the service Wechat</a>, which enables its users to conduct <a href="https://www.economist.com/news/business/21703428-chinas-wechat-shows-way-social-medias-future-wechats-world">nearly all the business of their daily lives</a>. What aspects of a culture might make it more feasible to implement such a service? Are there any drawbacks to conducting your life through a single platform? Why has WeChat had trouble expanding into new markets?
      </li><li>Hey, Siri! <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/siri-cortana-alexa-and-google-assistant-are-just-the-beginning-voice-is-the-future/">Voice-enabled technologies</a> allow us to effectively have conversations with robots. How do they differ from, and affect, those with flesh-and-blood people?
      </li><li>That filter on your selfie, that Photoshopped landscape—some consider the way we portray ourselves on social media to be deceptive, or to amount to a <a href="https://nypost.com/2015/10/11/our-double-lives-dark-realities-behind-perfect-online-profiles/">double life</a>. Discuss with your team: should people be more authentic on the Internet, and are there social benefits to altering reality?
      </li><li>Do you agree with MIT professor Sherry Turkle (in this <a href="http://niemanreports.org/articles/digital-demands-the-challenges-of-constant-connectivity/">slightly dated interview</a>) that social media offers the "illusion of companionship without the demands of friendship"? Discuss with your team: what, if any, *are* the demands of friendship, and do they vary online?
      </li><li>Look into the case of this <a href="http://archive.boston.com/business/technology/articles/2011/08/22/wormhole_links_mit_and_stanford/">wormhole</a> connecting students at Stanford and MIT. How does the wormhole try to emulate aspects of real-life friendship formation?
      </li><li>Consider <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/cslipublications/cslipublications/site/1575860538.shtml">the theory</a> (most associated with Stanford professor Clifford Nass) that humans relate to computers as if they, too, were human. Discuss with your team: have you found this theory (the so-called "Media Equation") to be true in your own lives? What are the implications for the design of computers and other gadgets, if so?
      </li><li>Much of this outline has focused on friendship, but we should take some time to study a very different sort of human relationship: that of enemies. Consider <a href="http://www.apa.org/monitor/jun05/perceptions.aspx">this article</a>, then discuss with your team: do you have any enemies? Does your family? What causes people to become enemies, and is the process reversible? Or, is the whole concept of enemies more applicable to fiction than to real life?
